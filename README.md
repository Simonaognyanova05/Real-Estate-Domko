# Graduation-project
This is my final project at school. The subject is "Real estate company - Domko".

The project is a web application for real estate management. It is built using Node.js, Express, Express-Handlebars and MongoDb. The languages ​​I used are HTML, CSS, Javascript. I worked on this project over a period of 4 months, during which I shaped the design, built functionality, wrote detailed documentation and worked on tasks set at the time of presentation.
